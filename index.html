					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi! I'm Emma! I'm a fourth year History of Art and Visual Culture major with a focus on curation, heritage, and museum work. I love art and I love to create it as much as, if not more than, I love to study it. Sometimes I get ideas from what I study, sometimes my ideas are totally new, and sometimes the projects I dream up are a cross between historical study and new art creation. As I am in my last quarter of my undergraduate career, I'm considering what I will study when I go on to get my graduate degree. I am from the Central Valley of California, and very proud to be, so I want my work to focus on the subcultures of this vast and diverse region of our state where so much agriculture, economy, and value exists. I am excited to see what I can do in a study of this region beyond what I know of it as someone who is a valley girl born and raised. I hope to study first hand, to document via photography and interviews, and to expand the world's knowledge of the region that I hold so dear to my heart.  </p>
